      <h2 id="The_Morning_by_The_Weeknd">"The Morning" by The Weeknd</h2>
      <p>The morning has come for Abel and his love interest, and the high from the previous night sends Abel’s girl departing and Abel himself
        into a candid, reflective state about his musical progression as well as the females that emerge in his nightlife: prostitutes and strippers.</p> <a href="https://genius.com/The-weeknd-the-morning-lyrics" target="_blank"> Lyrics</a>

      <h2 id="Impulse_by_Northlane">"Impulse" by Northlane</h2>
      <p>Impulse is the eighth song from Northlane’s third full-length album Node, and the third single from the album. Three days after the official album
        release, Rise Records uploaded the music video to their YouTube channel. The song lyrically talks about the relationship between people and the digital
        world we live in. With technology being a large part of daily life in the 21st century, this also brings about issues with people connecting with one another on a real, face-to-face level.</p> <a href="https://genius.com/Northlane-impulse-lyrics" target="_blank">Lyrics</a>

      <h2 id="I_No_Longer_Fear_The_Razor_Guarding_My_Heel_(IV)_by_$UICIDEBOY$">"I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel (IV)" by $UICIDEBOY$</h2>
      <p> The gothic yet vintage “I No Longer Fear the Razor Guarding My Heel IV” is the fourth installment of the I No Longer Fear The Razor Guarding My Heel
        series, released with I Want To Die In New Orleans as the concluding track 14. The installment is largely based around their feelings of doubting that
        the rap industry is right for them, along with the usual religion-based analogies, and their perpetual feeling of “losing”.</p> <a href="https://genius.com/Uicideboy-i-no-longer-fear-the-razor-guarding-my-heel-iv-lyrics" target="_blank"> Lyrics</a>

        number one on the German singles chart, after "You're My Heart, You're My Soul" and "You Can Win If You Want". "Cheri, Cheri Lady" was released on 2 September 1985,

      <h2 id="Will_He_by_Joji">"Will He" by Joji</h2>
      <p> “Will He” is Joji’s melancholy message to an ex-lover who’s found someone else. It’s the first single from In Tongues, his official debut project under this name. Joji
        first released a snippet of this song in May 2017 at his Boiler Room performance in Los Angeles.</p> <a href="https://genius.com/Joji-will-he-lyrics" target="_blank"> Lyrics </a>

      <h2 id="Stylo_by_Gorillaz">"Stylo" by Gorillaz</h2>
      <p> “Stylo” is sort of an extended allegory of the negative effects resulting from over-population, pollution, etc. It represents a conversation of sorts between 2D who represents
        human nature and Stylo, which represents the plastic fakeness of plastic beach. 2D is sort of singing sadly about the way things are going for humans and our inherent mechanization
        that will ultimately lead to our destruction.</p> <a href="https://genius.com/Gorillaz-stylo-lyrics" target="_blank"> Lyrics </a>

      <h2 id="Fine_Whine_by_A$AP_Rocky">"Fine Whine" by A$AP Rocky</h2>
      <p> This song is an ode to “lean” and broken relationships. Rocky, M.I.A. & Future have all been through breakups recently: Rocky with Chanel Iman , M.I.A. with Benjamin Bronfman & Future
        with his fiance Ciara.A$AP Rocky discovered the instrumental by searching for “asap rocky type beat” on the internet.</p> <a href="https://genius.com/A-ap-rocky-fine-whine-lyrics" target="_blank"> Lyrics </a>

      <h2 id="W.D.Y.W.F.M.?_by_The_Neighbourhood">"W.D.Y.W.F.M.?" by The Neighbourhood </h2>
      <p> “W.D.Y.W.F.M.” is an acronym for “What do you want from me?” and it’s one of the band’s favorite songs from their debut album I Love You. The song goes through the twists and turns of
        a relationship, leading the narrator into confusion and despair.</p> <a href="https://genius.com/The-neighbourhood-wdywfm-lyrics" target="_blank"> Lyrics </a>
